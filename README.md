Unofficial Temporary location for RRLS Rudder Pedals BOM

This is a draft and not the official BOM. Use at your own risk. You will need to compare this with the CAD file avaiable on patreon to make sure you're getting the right parts. (Available here: https://patreon.com/RightRudderLeftStick)
BOM currently missing several parts. Mostly M5 and M8 nuts. Working onupdating and will upload soon. (I will delete this line when I do so)

Currently working on a quick-and-dirty joystick code to get this working with a Teesny 3.2 and adafruit MLX90393
No rhyme or reason for choosing these boards. I had them on-hand. They are certianly more expensive than the bluepill solution used on the RRLS Very-Big-Stick and not compatible with freejoy or MMjoy so I cannot recommend them unless you already have them on hand.
Should work on a teensy 4 as well.

This will be removed/hidden when the official BOM is available on patreon or publicly.
